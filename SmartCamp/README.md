Smart Camp project main idea is to reduce using of electrical power and depends on the machine,
By controlling building lights through the Mobile app (UART communication protocol between Atmega32 microcontroller and Bluetooth module),
In addition to measures, the temperature through sensor pass it to ADC channel to control the fan based on a threshold value.
Also, the main light in the street will be turned on only if we are in the night and there is someone is moving around (using LDR to direct the light to make sure that we are in the night and PIR motion sensor to detect any kind of motion).
